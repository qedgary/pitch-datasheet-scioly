# pitch-datasheet-scioly
This repository provides a Java-based approach to generating a datasheet for the 2020-21 Science Olympiad event "Sounds of Music." The Java Driver class `datasheetGenerator` prompts the user to enter information on a team's instrument, and Java will automatically generate LaTeX output, which should be input (via copying-and-pasting) into the preamble of the example `tex` file. I'm still tinkering around, so I hope in the future I'll be able to get Java to create a separate `txt` file which can be directly imported into LaTeX, skipping the need to copy and paste.

## On customization
The PDF of the Sounds of Music datasheet is generated by running XeLaTeX on the `tex` source file on a Windows computer. If you're generating the PDF on a different operating system or on Overleaf, you'll want to swap the default font (Segoe UI) for something that's available on your operating system. For the `\sharp` and `\flat` commands, you'll also want a font that supports the Unicode code ranges for these characters. You'll also want to set your typesetting engine to XeLaTeX. Many commands in the document rely on XeLaTeX, including font, sharps, flats, and urls, so there may be a substantial amount of effort if you try to edit it to work for LuaLaTeX or `pdflatex` instead of XeLaTeX.
